# 🚀 Getting Started with Git in VS Code

This guide helps you set up and use Git in **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) with clear steps and tips.


## 🛠️ 1. Prerequisites

Before using Git in VS Code, make sure:

- ✅ **Git is installed** on your system:  
  👉 Download from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)  
  👉 Check with:  
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

* ✅ **VS Code is installed**:    
  👉 Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

---

## 🔧 2. Configure Git (First Time Only)

Set your identity for commits:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

(Optional) Set default branch name to `main`:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Check your config:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## 🏗️ 3. Start a Git Project

### ➕ Create a New Git Repo

```bash
git init
```

This creates a `.git` folder to track your project.

### 📥 Clone an Existing Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
```

---

## 💻 4. Use Git in VS Code

### 🧭 Open the Source Control Panel

Click the **Source Control** icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).

* 📝 See changed files
* ➕ Stage files
* ✅ Commit with a message
* 📤 Push to GitHub

> You can also run Git commands in the **Terminal** (\`Ctrl+\`\`).

---

## 🔍 5. (Optional) Git Graph Extension

Install **Git Graph** from Extensions:

* 🔎 Visualize commit history
* 🌲 See branches clearly
* 👇 Run `Git Graph: View Git Graph` from command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)

---

## 📦 6. Typical Git Workflow

```bash
git status                # Check what's changed
git add .                 # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"   # Save changes
git push origin main      # Upload to GitHub
```

---

## 🌐 7. Connect Local Repo to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚠️ 8. Tips & Best Practices

| ✅ Tip                         | 💡 Description                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Install Git first             | VS Code needs system Git           |
| Always commit with a message  | Be clear and meaningful            |
| Use `.gitignore`              | Avoid committing unwanted files    |
| Use branches                  | Don’t experiment on `main`         |
| Avoid `--force` unless needed | Can overwrite remote history       |
| Commit often                  | Small commits are easier to manage |
| Pull before push              | Avoid conflicts                    |

## 🧯 9. Troubleshooting: "No source control providers registered"

If you see this message in VS Code:

> ❌ **"No source control providers registered"**

It usually means one of the following:

1. **You didn't open a Git folder**  
   👉 Run `git init` in your project folder to start version control.

2. **Git is not installed**  
   👉 Install Git from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

3. **Git is disabled in VS Code**  
   👉 Go to Settings → search `git.enabled` → make sure it's ✅ enabled.  
   👉 Or check `settings.json` for this line and set it to true:
   ```json
   "git.enabled": true
